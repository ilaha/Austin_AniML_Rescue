## Austin AniML Rescue in Tableau Public
[Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) will be the data visualization tool used to create the final dashboard for the Austin AniML Rescue machine learning project.

Tableau is an interactive data visualization software harnessing business intelligence to simplify raw data into easily understandable worksheets, dashboards, and stories. Therefore our data project team chose Tableau as the dashboard because of its immersive interactive platform.  To capitalize on Tableauâ€™s interactivity, several filters, color marks, quick table calculations, and other Tableau features have been added to the Austin AniML Rescue dashboard. These enhanced features allow the user to drilldown by animal type, breed, intake type, outcome type, etc.
