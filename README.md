## Presentation
Draft information for our presentation.

- Topic and Reason for selecting 
  - This project studies data from the [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/content/austin-animal-center) in Austin, TX. We chose this topic because we would like to help the Austin Animal Center better understand information on their animals so that as many animals as possible have a positive outcome.

- Data Source Description: There are two datasets posted by the Animal Center as csv files: intakes (information on animals brought to the shelter) and outcomes (information on animals when they leave the shelter). The information dates from 2013 to present and is updated daily on the Austin Animal Center data website. Variables in the dataset include an Animal ID, Animal Name, Animal Type, Breed, Color, Dates of intake and outcome, Sex, etc. 
  - Links to the raw original datasets:

    - [Austin Animal Center Outcomes](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/Austin-Animal-Center-Outcomes/9t4d-g238)

- Questions to answer: We have two main questions that we are interested in answering, along with related subquestions. Question 1 is a regression prediction, and question 2 is a categorical prediction.
  1. Can we predict the length of stay at the shelter for animals?
    - What factors most influence the length of stay?
    - Are the factors that influence the length of stay different for different animals?
  2. Can we predict the outcome for an animal based on other characteristics?
    - What are the possible outcomes that we should consider?
    - What factors most influence the determination of the outcome?
  
# Austin AniML Rescue communication protocol
## To ensure that the group receive consistent messages, we create a communication protocol outlines, where we identify the person responsibilities inside the final Bootcamp project.  
### Everyone in the Austin AniML Rescue project has a role to play in communication:
•	Ilaha mammadzada (square) is the manager and responsible for the repository.
•	Melinda Malone (circle) is in charge of the merging and cleaning of the data set, to make sure the database will work seamlessly with the rest of the project
•	Sarah Griffin (X) are in charge of deciding which technologies will be used for each step of the project as well as working in machine learning model.
•	Arlena Wu  (triangle) is in charge to create a sample of a machine leaning model for the project. Where she show and explain how it will work with the rest of the project steps.
•	Ruth Ortiz (x) and (triangle) is in charge to create the diagram that explains how it the project works by creating a visualization illustration in tableau.
## Everybody is responsible to voice their concerns and issues, provide feedbacks and listen to the other effectively.

## We had stablish our best communication vehicles should be:
•	Location: we are open to meet in person on the weekends and online during the week days.
•	Virtual team-meetings: we will rely in video calls for specific coordination about the main point in the project, as well as for give a feedback about the development and results from the project.
•	Timing: our schedule is pretty flexible for group work meetings and always open to consider everybody availability
•	Face to face meetings: everybody in the group is open to face to face meetings when we need to coordinate important subjects in the project.
•	Messages: We are actives to have an effective quick answer on slack and in text messages, the number of integrant in the team don’t affect our communication.
•	Mail: it may be used when information is urgent, but we would pick slack.
•	Slack: we choose as main messaging space to resolve small concerns for the quick and fast to answer
