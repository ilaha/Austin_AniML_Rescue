# Outline of the Project and Organization of the Main Branch

## Presentation
Our presentation is available as a [pdf file](https://github.com/ilaha/Austin_AniML_Rescue/blob/main/Austin%20Animal%20rescue.pdf) and as Google Slides document [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/120N6hRfooHchPLMDeCw5GEKs5dT-I0a_T48jhp-UGSE/edit?usp=sharing). The Google Slides presentation is read-only via the second link and may be a more updated copy than the pdf.


## Machine Learning Model
For predicting the animal outcome, our current sketch of our pipeline is to move from the SQL data into Python for cleaning, spliting into the training and testing sets, and then utilize a Random Forest Classifier.

# Austin AniML Rescue Team Communication Protocol

To ensure consistent messaging, we created a communication protocol outlining the responsibilities for each person in the group project.

### Communication Roles:
The roles will change during the final project so that each member has the opportunity to learn about each piece of the project and practice the related skills.

 - ***Role 1***: Repository management. This team member leads efforts to maintain the GitHub repository, including resolving merge conflicts, and help keep the main branch as the source of our most recent working code. This person also updates the Readme.md file on the main branch as changes are made to the GitHub repo.
 - ***Role 2***: Project management. This team member leads the efforts for knowing what deliverables are required for the UT Bootcamp at each stage and assuring that the work the team is doing leads to successful fulfillment of the deliverables. This includes comparing the work to the rubric requirements as posted for class and helping to decide which technologies are used at each step of the project.
 - ***Role 3***: ML modeling. This team member works on the coding aspect of the ML model as well as data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
 - ***Role 4***: Database & Dashboard management. This team member maintains and updates the database (PgAdmin4) as needed and leads the efforts for creating and maintaining our final dashboard.
 - ***Role 5***: Presentation management. This team member writes the presentation files and helps other team members as needed.


### Additional Team Communication Agreements
Based on our team discussions, we also developed the following agreements.
 - Everybody is responsible to providing feedback on Group Work.
 - After committing work to the appropriate branch, submit a pull request once you believe the work is ready to be merged to the main branch.
 - Two additional team members need to review the work as soon as possible and leave comments.
 - A third team member completes the final review and merges the changes. This should be the person serving as the Repository manager for that week of the project.
 - If significant changes are required to the commit, it is advised to ask the original author to revise the work and submit a new commit. Then the process starts again.


### Communication Tools and Timing

- ***Location***: Meet in person on the weekends and online during the week nights.

 - ***Virtual team-meetings***: Use video calls for specific coordination about the project and for giving feedback.
     
- ***Timing***: Meet during class times on Monday and Wednesday nights. Consider everyone's availability when scheduling meetings outside of  class time.

- ***Face to face meetings***: Open to in-person meetings if needed and can be done safely.

- ***Messages***: Use Slack and text message for questions where you need a quick answer.

- ***eMail***: May be used when information is urgent, but prefer Slack or text. Team members setup notifications from GitHub.
